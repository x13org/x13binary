Description: The US Census Bureau provides a seasonal adjustment program now
 called 'X-13ARIMA-SEATS' building on both earlier programs called X-11 and
 X-12 as well as the SEATS program by the Bank of Spain. The US Census Bureau
 offers both source and binary versions -- which this package integrates for
 use by other R packages.
